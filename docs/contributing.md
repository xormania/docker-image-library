# Maintaining and expanding xorder

Use feature branches and PRs against master. The canonical source layout is:

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `images/*/definition.json` | Authored intent, runtime/OS lines, revisions, capabilities, limitations and changes |
| `images/*/Dockerfile` | Build recipe |
| `images/shared/` | Shared tools and workspace/user handling |
| `images/tools.json` | Resolved Composer/uv digests, PECL versions and verified Symfony CLI artifact |
| `release-records/<family>/<line>/<revision>.json` | Published, behavior-tested release facts; created by publication |
| `artifacts/<kind>/<name>/definition.json` | Authored binary, environment, configuration, or context contract |
| `artifacts/<kind>/<name>/payload/` | Explicit bundle inputs and upstream notices |
| `release-records/artifacts/<kind>/<name>/<revision>.json` | Verified downloadable artifact facts; created by publication |
| `profiles/` | Explicit role choices and exact resource revisions |
| `schemas/` | Definition/release/catalog structure; cross-field invariants live in the validator |
| `catalog.json`, `catalog-v2.json`, README tables, `docs/images/`, `docs/resources/index.md`, `docs/releases/` | Generated outputs |
| `scripts/` | Small build, inventory, release, generation and refresh helpers |
| `scripts/xorder/` | Shared typed model, resolution, transport, application, and artifact release helpers |
| `tests/fixtures/`, `tests/requirements/` | Locked real consumer fixtures and independent mock requirements |

The image paths remain stable. [Architecture](architecture.md) describes the
extension boundaries for binaries, environments, configuration, context, and
profiles. Add a new path with its first meaningful definition or implementation;
do not create empty category directories or list an unverified resource as
available. Keep one normalized resource model and generate any compatibility
views from it. Existing image selection inputs and outputs are compatibility
contracts while generic discovery is introduced.

Local metadata validation:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-ci.txt
python3 scripts/library.py generate
python3 scripts/library.py check
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

For a downloadable resource, pin an exact upstream URL and SHA-256 or declare
every authored payload file. Set its prerequisites, owned destination paths,
limitations, usage page, and behavior verifier in the definition. Allocate a new
SemVer packaging revision for changed input bytes, executable modes, destination
paths, or verification behavior. Fingerprints normalize payload modes to `0644`
or `0755`; executable intent is part of the release input.

Run its actual packaging and readiness check before opening the PR:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=scripts python3 -m xorder.verify verify KIND/NAME
```

Publication checks the anonymous released bytes again before proposing a durable
release record. Review and merge that record through normal metadata checks;
only then does generation expose the resource as available. Definitions and
profile pins alone cannot make a release selectable. Update a native environment's
committed lock through its backend and verify that readiness leaves it unchanged.
Keep profile updates explicit: adding a newer accepted resource does not upgrade
an existing profile, resolution lock, or managed installation.

On a Docker-capable host, use `scripts/build.py LINE_ID LOCAL_TAG` and
`scripts/verify-image.sh LINE_ID IMAGE`. Derived build input must be the exact
matching parent artifact; PR tests reuse an available matching digest or use the
just-built local parent. Publication
uses its immutable registry digest. Image builds collect measured versions,
packages, runtime and extensions using `scripts/inventory.py`.

Before editing a released recipe/input, allocate the appropriate image revision
and write meaningful `changes` plus migration guidance in the line definition.
Do not hand-edit measured tool versions in generated docs. A global shared tool
refresh intentionally changes all consumers; image-specific changes stay scoped.
README/docs/record-only PRs do not rebuild images. The release jobs additionally
skip source-identical lines already in the accepted ledger.

Validation scopes container jobs to changed recipes and consuming fixtures;
release orchestration and unit-test changes still run metadata tests. Unknown
build/verification helpers conservatively select all images. Publication also
checks the accepted ledger before allocating runners, retaining incomplete PHP
parent/browser pairs and changed-input guards.

PR image selection keeps exact behavior targets within each shared parent build
tree. Recipe, copied-input, tool-pin, and definition changes test their consumers
and descendants. A change confined to one definition line tests only that line
and its descendants; a change to the family's common definition tests every line.
Fixture and runner changes test only the images that execute them. Ancestors
provide exact build inputs without repeating their own behavior checks, and
unaffected sibling branches are skipped. Matching available parent artifacts are
pulled by digest; missing or changed parents are built before the selected child.

Catalog and known schema-only changes run metadata validation. Shared image
orchestration changes, including `validate.yml`, and unknown runtime helpers
still exercise all images because their impact spans the validation path.
Metadata/schema/unit checks run on every PR, and `checks` accepts intentionally
skipped runtime jobs while failing on failed or cancelled required jobs.

Inspect selection without building:

```sh
python3 scripts/library.py validation-matrix --base BASE_COMMIT
python3 scripts/library.py validation-matrix --all
```

The matrix records each parent tree and its `verify_lines`, also shown in the
workflow summary. The existing `affected` root-list interface remains available.
For a toolkit-only local check:

```sh
python3 scripts/build.py php-dev/8.5-trixie image-library-check:dev \
  --children --reuse-accepted --verify-lines '["php-toolkit/8.5-trixie"]'
```

Manual `Validate` runs and the weekly Tuesday 06:23 UTC schedule exercise every
image, resource, environment, and application surface. Unchanged available
images are still reused for runtime checks; these runs do not publish images.

After a successful validation of the same PR and unchanged base, image selection
compares the next update with that successful ancestral head. Failed runs,
changed bases, unrelated force-pushes, and unavailable history fall back to the
full PR delta. Metadata tests always run; an unchanged image does not need another
build merely because a review fix changed another image.

New revisions use version-2 fingerprints of their Dockerfile, its local COPY
inputs, executable modes, `.dockerignore`, and consumed tool pins. PHP-only
shared files do not change Rust or Python fingerprints. Derived fingerprints
also bind the exact accepted parent digest. Historical release records retain
their original algorithm and evidence; migration belongs to fresh revisions.
Tool-file changes select only consumers of the keys that actually changed.
Validation pulls an unchanged available accepted digest and runs selected behavior
without building it. Missing or changed artifacts still build and verify normally. The optional
`--cache-probe` checks source-label layer reuse when explicitly requested.

Build caches use family-specific input fingerprints rather than commit SHAs.
Source labels are applied after install layers. Each image revision is passed
as `APT_REFRESH`, intentionally invalidating Debian package installs during a
weekly refresh. PHP CI uses Docker's containerd image store so its exact local
parent remains visible while both parent and browser caches can be exported.
Build artifacts and job summaries retain image size and build/verification
times. A source-label-only rebuild checks that filesystem layers stay identical.

The repository is now `xormania/xorder`; existing GHCR package names are unchanged.
Dockerfile source labels still record the former repository URL. Update those
labels with the next deliberate image refresh, allocate new patch revisions for
every affected line and derived consumer, and run normal build/publication
verification. Changing a label changes the input fingerprint even when the
filesystem layers are unchanged. Keep that image-input change separate from
documentation-only rename work; never rebuild an accepted exact revision or
rewrite historical release evidence to disguise it.

PR build metrics describe validation artifacts; they are not published release
facts. Measured release facts belong in verified `release-records/`, and their
documentation is generated from that ledger in the image/release pages and
[release measurements](metrics.md). Publication records local image size,
measurement method/store, timestamps, evidence, and public-artifact verification
time. Fresh builds also record build time and external cache input; resumed
artifacts have no invented build time.

Size comparisons use the preceding available accepted revision. Publication
reuses its recorded size when the method/store match, or anonymously pulls its
digest and measures it in the current store. This supports older records without
metrics without rewriting their durable release assets. A comparison appears
only when that accepted baseline is present; missing measurements stay absent.
Rebuild timings depend on cache state and runner/network conditions; compare
equivalent inputs rather than treating one run as a guaranteed duration.

`Refresh build inputs` runs weekly and manually. It resolves upstream digests,
PECL versions and the Symfony/Infection artifact checksums, then stages fresh
patch revisions only for changed consumers and their descendants. It tracks
Debian main amd64 package-index checksums for Trixie, updates and security;
changed package feeds trigger the apt consumers. Release dates and signatures
alone do not allocate rebuilds. Identical resolved inputs create no refresh PR.
These checksums observe repository changes; Debian packages remain measured
from the resulting artifact rather than claimed to come from a frozen snapshot.
Review upstream compatibility/security changes and adjust
the revision when a patch refresh would break the contract. Never reuse an exact
release for a fresh build. Dependabot proposes Actions/validation dependency
updates separately.

Fixtures have committed Composer, uv and Cargo locks. Updating a fixture lock
is a source change and reruns behavior, rather than substituting the fixture's
dependency versions for the consuming project's own lock. No global PHPUnit,
Panther, CUE or speculative Cargo tools are bundled.

Browser parity also pins the accepted application-image digest alongside its
consumer commit. Publication stages a candidate without executing consumer
code. A separate job with no repository permissions, persisted checkout
credentials, or registry login verifies that public digest. Its Compose
configuration belongs to xorder, ignores consumer Compose/dotenv files, and
rejects bind paths escaping the disposable checkout. The runner receives an
explicit minimal environment. Finalization requires successful evidence bound
to the exact digest, source, image inputs and parity fixture; it does not rerun
consumer code with publication credentials.

To add a family/line, inspect the target project's requirements, choose an
official upstream base and resolve its digest, define its intended profile,
extend the build/inventory/behavior recipes, add independent selection scenarios,
and keep it unavailable until the shared publication path produces a verified
record. Extend platform schema/build/tests together before adding arm64.
Keep discovery usable from the repository URL without a pipeline service, MCP
server, or installed discovery skill. A selected context resource may contain a
skill; that payload is independent of the discovery entry point. Reuse common
release evidence and orchestration, with kind-specific build/verification and
application behavior. Configuration/context changes must not rebuild unrelated
images.

Pins make build inputs traceable; apt repositories and project download
services still change. Byte-for-byte reproducible rebuilds are not claimed.

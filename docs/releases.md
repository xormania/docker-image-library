# Publication and recovery

## HTTP resources

The same publication workflow also handles binary, environment, configuration,
and context resources. Their authored intent lives under `artifacts/`; accepted
facts live under `release-records/artifacts/`. Image publication and existing
GHCR names keep their established behavior.

Source PR validation retrieves the pinned upstream binary or packages only the
declared bundle files, then exercises those exact staged bytes. Environment jobs
install a pinned Nix/devenv toolchain and execute the native locked environment.
These PR results are verification evidence, not public release availability.

After master accepts the source, each independently versioned resource uses its
`<kind>/<name>/v<revision>` source tag and GitHub Release:

1. Prepare exact payload bytes. Bundle archives contain the declared paths from
   `payload/`, with deterministic headers and no links or special files.
2. Create a draft Release at the original source commit and upload the payload
   without replacing any existing asset. A retry compares existing bytes.
3. Publish that Release so its assets can be retrieved without credentials.
4. Download its public asset anonymously, check its exact checksum and size,
   and execute the kind's trusted verifier against the downloaded payload.
5. Upload the durable passed `record.json` without `--clobber`, then stage the
   accepted record and generated discovery views through the existing PR flow.

GitHub draft assets cannot provide anonymous download verification. Therefore a
public Release can exist while verification or catalog acceptance is pending.
Only accepted verified records appear as available in the catalog. A failed
runtime or corrupted public download never produces an available recommendation.

On retry, a persisted record identifies the artifact and original source.
Without a record, publication verifies and reuses the existing candidate at its
original source commit; it never replaces payload bytes. A different input at an
existing revision requires a new revision. Authentication/API failures do not
mean that a release is absent. Catalog writeback rechecks the public asset and
source Release before accepting it. It advances no HTTP aliases.

Configuration/context-only changes avoid image build jobs. Native environment
checks run only for affected environments; common delivery changes exercise the
resource consumers. Existing image input guards and release concurrency remain.

## Image publication

Source PRs build and execute behavioral fixtures on Linux amd64. After a source
PR lands on master, `Publish verified images` follows this path:

1. Build each changed/unreleased line with locked base digests and version labels.
2. Exercise the public readiness recipe and collect actual inventory.
3. Push a separate source/revision-qualified candidate tag. Pull that same
   artifact by digest without credentials, and execute its readiness recipe.
4. Persist `record.json` and the inventory as assets on a draft namespaced
   GitHub Release before changing an exact tag.
5. Promote the candidate digest to the exact tag. Refuse any different existing
   digest, verify the public exact reference and publish the source Release.
6. Open a PR containing verified release records and generated catalog/docs.
   Partial successes may be cataloged independently; failed exact promotions
   are excluded by writeback.
7. After this PR lands, `Promote accepted aliases` fetches the latest master
   ledger and points compatible aliases to its newest available revisions.

The source tag identifies the build commit. The generated documentation commit
is later. The GitHub Release assets retain the definition and inventory needed
to understand the exact historical artifact. The root README describes accepted
available images. Image source changes and record-only writeback have distinct
workflow path filters, preventing a publication loop.

The release/alias workflows share a repository-wide concurrency group, preserve
up to 100 pending runs with `queue: max`, and do not cancel in-progress promotion.
Different line jobs within a release may run
in parallel. An older queued job reads the current accepted ledger before
advancing an alias; it cannot overwrite a newer accepted recommendation.
Promotion resolves all desired exact references before writing any aliases and
skips aliases already pointing to the accepted digest. Its job summary identifies
unchanged, updated, failed and still-pending aliases. A registry failure during
writes can still leave a partial update; rerunning resumes by skipping matches.

## First publication setup

The repository uses GitHub-hosted runners. Master has an active PR ruleset,
allows merge commits, and has automatic merge disabled as inspected on
8 October 2026. Automation stages protected-branch changes in PRs; it does not
bypass those controls or invent an automatic merge entitlement.

Required settings:

- Permit Actions and the pinned official actions used by these workflows.
- Permit the workflow token to create/write repository-associated GHCR packages
  and GitHub Releases. Source PR validation uses read-only repository permissions.
- Permit automation to create PRs. `LIBRARY_BOT_TOKEN` is an optional repository
  secret for a suitably scoped bot token, so bot-created PRs trigger normal CI.
  PRs created or updated with `GITHUB_TOKEN` require **Approve workflows to run**
  in the PR's merge box. Use the bot token for automatic validation.
  For this public, personally owned repository, `xor-machine` can use a classic
  PAT with `public_repo` after accepting a collaborator invitation. Fine-grained
  PATs do not currently support cross-account repository collaborators.
  Store the token as `LIBRARY_BOT_TOKEN`; PR writeback uses REST and does not
  require `read:org`. Renew the token before its chosen expiration.
  Never commit the token. See GitHub's [token limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
  and [workflow trigger rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow).
- After the first candidate push, set each GHCR package (`php-dev`,
  `php-browser`, `rust-dev`, `python-dev`) to **public** using its package settings.
  GHCR creates packages private by default and provides no container-visibility
  mutation in this workflow. Rerun the failed publication job; it will reuse the
  candidate, not rebuild. Browser packages are created after their PHP parent
  passes, so first publication can need a second visibility/setup pass.
- Merge generated catalog/input-refresh PRs using the permitted merge method.
  Fully unattended default-branch writeback needs an explicitly authorized
  merge mechanism consistent with the current ruleset; it is not configured
  merely by adding these workflows.

Actual package permissions and anonymous pulling are checked by publication,
not assumed because a repository is public. There are no stable published
references until that succeeds and the records are accepted.

## Retry and failure boundaries

GitHub, git and the registry do not form an atomic transaction.

| Failure point | Recovery |
| --- | --- |
| Build/test before candidate push | Fix the failure and retry; no stable recommendation changed |
| Candidate pushed, public pull blocked | Make package public/fix network, rerun; existing candidate is pulled and tested |
| Record persisted, exact promotion failed | Rerun; download durable record and promote the same digest |
| Exact/GitHub Release succeeded, docs PR failed | Rerun; use release asset and restage docs; old aliases remain |
| Docs merged, alias job failed | Rerun `Promote accepted aliases`; fetch current ledger and verify exact references |
| Exact tag exists with a different digest | Stop; workflow refuses overwrite; allocate a fresh revision or recover the intended record |
| Existing record cannot be fetched | Stop; do not interpret an API failure as an absent release |
| Last available revision withdrawn/deprecated with an existing alias | Stop before any alias updates; restore a verified available replacement or retire the alias tag while retaining exact artifacts, then rerun |
| Refresh branch pushed, PR creation failed | Rerun; fetch/reuse the branch, merge current master, and recover the PR even when the generated files are unchanged |

Refresh writeback prepares its branch before resolving upstream inputs. Reruns
allocate the proposed revision from current master, preserving a pending
refresh's revision instead of incrementing it again, and use ordinary pushes.
`python3 scripts/writeback.py --refresh` performs that complete refresh flow.

The candidate tag includes full source SHA and revision. A different-input retry
of a persisted revision fails, requiring a new revision. An exact tag without
its durable record is ambiguous and requires recovery, not a silent rebuild.
No failed candidate advances the catalog or alias. GitHub Release publication
alone does not complete catalog writeback and alias promotion; workflow status
and the default-branch catalog show those separate steps.

Retain all exact released artifacts required by projects. Candidate cleanup is
separate: inspect package version tags and record digests, preserve any version
referenced by an exact tag or release record, and only remove abandoned,
unreferenced candidates after review. Do not apply generic registry retention
to released digest pins. Docker Hub mirroring is a later optional step and would
need its own anonymous-pull verification before entering the catalog.

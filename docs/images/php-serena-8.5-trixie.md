## Limitations

- No PHP-FPM, web server daemon, or Node toolchain is supplied.
- PCOV is disabled by default. library-php-coverage pcov isolates Xdebug for each CLI process; library-php-tests uses project-locked PHPUnit and PHPStan, not global test packages.
- PHP semantic operations are backed by PHPactor; Twig and Symfony container/service semantics are not established by PHP symbol tests.
- Project PHP dependencies come from Composer lockfiles.
- Serena is pinned to the tested v2 beta revision b79e2a55f9d4072084977dd35bd07d31146d88b9.
- The REPL can execute Python with container permissions. The standalone runner does not implement Agentscient role permissions or coordination.
- The consuming project owns its Composer dependencies. Prepared language-server startup needs no runtime downloads.
- The public runner mounts source read-only by default; pass --write explicitly for trusted editing sessions.
- The runner uses temporary session state. REPL variables, indexes and new memories do not survive process restart.
- Xdebug is off by default; enable with XDEBUG_MODE=coverage or debug.
